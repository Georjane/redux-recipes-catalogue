# Catalogue of Recipes 
## Project Description

This project is a React capstone based on a catalogue of recipes. It is not an app to help you make a recipe. It is a catalogue with a browsable list of items that you can filter and have access to the details of one item.
The webapp has at least 2 types of pages:

- one page with a list of food items that could be filtered by category;
- one page for the food item details;

Data was collected from an API from the React application. A catalogue of meals, using [Meals DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## Technical requirements of the project
1. The project is a single page application(SPA) built with React and Redux. 
2. The data that is retrieved from the API is stored in the Redux store
3. We filter the data that is retrieve from the API using a Filter stateless component
4. Every page, the main page and pages for each item, has a unique route within the SPA
5. The project is deployed and accessible online
